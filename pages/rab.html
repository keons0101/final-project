                    Regional at Best is the second studio album by the American band Twenty One Pilots, and its first as the core duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun. Self-released on July 8, 2011, it was the band's final independent record before being signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2012, and has since been discontinued and out of print.</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    Critics compared Regional at Best to the band's 2009 self-titled debut album and felt that it set a new basis for the style and tone of future albums. Several Regional at Best songs such as "Car Radio", "Holding On to You" and "Guns for Hands" were re-recorded for Twenty One Pilots' next album, their 2013 major-label debut, Vessel.</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    Twenty One Pilots was formed in 2009 by high school friends Tyler Joseph and Nick Thomas, as well as Chris Salih. The trio built a regional following across Ohio and the Midwest with constant and energetic touring, shrewd use of interactive social media, and connecting with fans on a grassroots level. They self-released their eponymous debut album of what Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic characterized as rap-infused, high-tech pop in December 2009 before Thomas and Salih left the band in 2011. Frontman Tyler Joseph recruited replacement drummer Josh Dun before the release of Regional at Best and Twenty One Pilots continued as a duo.</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    Regional at Best was self-released independently on July 8, 2011; Twenty One Pilots paid a company to print the CDs and had them ready for people to buy at shows at their merch table. Dun explained in a 2023 variety stream that the band put out their independent records so that they would have music to play live: "At that time, we were kinda like, 'Let's just put something together - that way we can play shows.' And so it wasn't a professionally recorded record; it was really just material to go and play." Joseph added that Regional at Best was "Something for people to buy to get enough gas money to get to the next show!"</p>
