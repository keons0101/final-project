                    Trench is the fifth studio album by the American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, released on October 5, 2018, through Fueled by Ramen and Elektra Records. It was the band's first studio album in three years, after the breakthrough success of their previous studio album, Blurryface (2015). Recorded in secret during a year-long public silence, it is a concept album which explores mental health, suicide, and doubt, themes prominently featured in the band's previous works, framed in the metaphorical city of Dema and the surrounding continent known as "Trench". The album was also the first release of the newly revived Elektra Music Group.</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    The album was preceded by the release of four singles. The first two, "Jumpsuit" and "Nico and the Niners", were both released on July 11, 2018. The third single, "Levitate", was released on August 8, 2018. The fourth single, "My Blood", was released on August 27, 2018. Two follow-up singles, "Chlorine" and "The Hype", were released on January 22 and July 16, 2019, respectively. To promote the album, the band embarked on the Bandito Tour, which began at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee on October 16, 2018, and concluded at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois on December 13, 2019.</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    Trench received acclaim from critics, who praised its ambition, songwriting and cohesive production; many contrasted it favorably with Blurryface. Several publications placed the record on their year-end lists of 2018, with Rock Sound naming it the best album of the year. It was also a commercial success, reaching number one in six countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Spain and the Netherlands, and number two in several countries, notably the United Kingdom and United States</p>
                <p class="about__text">
                    Trench continues the band's exploration of themes surrounding insecurity, faith, suicide, and mental health, prominent themes on Twenty One Pilots' previous albums. The album was formed around the conceptual world of "Trench", created by Joseph and represented through the album's accompanying marketing and music videos.</p>
